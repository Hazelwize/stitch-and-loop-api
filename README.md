## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

This is an API made from mostly Node.js running the Express.js framework on top. It allows you to pull information from the API about many different crochet types and styles. It is currently deployed to heroku for use by anyone that feels like adding it to their site.
## Optimizations

I would like to add many different types of stitches, yarn size explanations, pictures etc. There is so much to cover, but I hope that one day I can use the data gathered to make a pattern maker using different stitch types. 
## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to manage response and request objects with various middleware. I used my knowledge in JavaScript to implement various ways that the client could use url paths and query parameters to find exactly what they were looking for. This showed me how valuable creating RESTful APIs is when thinking of the front end user.
## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
